PHOTOGRAMMETRY PROCESSING INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

Project Type: General
Total Images: 0
Preparation Date: 2025-04-03 22:26:40

RECOMMENDED SOFTWARE OPTIONS:
----------------------------
1. Meshroom (Free, Open Source)
   - Website: https://alicevision.org/#meshroom
   - Good for: General photogrammetry, objects, small scenes

2. OpenDroneMap (Free, Open Source)
   - Website: https://www.opendronemap.org/
   - Good for: Aerial mapping, terrain modeling

3. Metashape (Commercial)
   - Website: https://www.agisoft.com/
   - Good for: Professional use, all types of photogrammetry

4. RealityCapture (Commercial)
   - Website: https://www.capturingreality.com/
   - Good for: High-quality, fast processing

IMPORT INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------------
1. Import all images from the 'final' directory: processed/test_session_20250403_222640/final
2. For most software, use the highest quality settings for initial testing
3. Ensure adequate RAM is available (16GB+ recommended)
4. Expect processing to take several hours for high-quality results

COMMON ISSUES AND SOLUTIONS:
---------------------------
1. Poor reconstruction: Add more overlapping images
2. Holes in model: Ensure complete coverage of all angles
3. Processing errors: Try adjusting feature matching settings
4. Not enough RAM: Reduce image resolution or use fewer images

OUTPUTS TO EXPECT:
-----------------
1. Point cloud (sparse and dense)
2. 3D mesh
3. Textured 3D model
4. Orthomosaic (for terrain)
